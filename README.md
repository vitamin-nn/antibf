# Anti bruteforce Service
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/vitamin-nn/otus_anti_bruteforce.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/vitamin-nn/otus_anti_bruteforce)
## Overview
The service was made to control the rate of authentication requests.
Based on the loginning user data (login, password, ip) and service settings it defines whether the request is a brute force attempt.
The service works with GRPC and Command line interfaces.
